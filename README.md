# Korrin-F Portfolio

## Description
Welcome to my portfolio! The design is very much my style so it was a lot of fun to make. In the interest of practicing React I have built the portfolio as a React app. The hero image was created using AI and from there I chose a matching and complimentary colour pallete. I also chose three font families from Adobe fonts that suites the over all asethetic. 



## Installation

The packages are managed using NPM.
